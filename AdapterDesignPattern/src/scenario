The adapter design pattern is useful when you need to integrate 2 complex apps together, for example.
It can be of two types:
-1)Class
-2)Interfaces

Example of scenario:
	We have a video streaming. The old format of videos is changed with another one. We have to take care of this problem 
	without modifying existing code.
	
	As a consequence, we have to implement the new interface of the used class. 
	The newly created class will have an object of the old type. 
	
	If we are talking about Interface adapter, we have to implement both of the interfaces.
