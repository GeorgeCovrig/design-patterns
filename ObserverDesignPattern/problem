Let's imagine the way mailing works. We can subscribe to different sites.
This pattern has two main sides: the observer and the observable.

The 0bserver is the one that waits for the data, in our case the person that subscribes to a site.
The Observable is the site that sends the data.

We will implement this design pattern in the simplest way, and then using Generics.
